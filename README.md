FizzBuzzGame For Sogeti Technical Assessment 

Instructions on how to execute program:
Run FizzBuzzGame.exe
Input either R or a number.
R will take you to the custom rule adding while a number will delve straight into FizzBuzzPop
Program will then ask if you would like to play again. Y/y will loop the program again, any other input will result in the program exiting.

Notes:
I coded this in VS2017 and it doesnt require special attention upon building the program.
