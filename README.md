# FizzBuzzGame
FizzBuzzGame For Sogeti Technical Assessment 
-------------

Instructions on how to execute program:
Run FizzBuzzGame.exe
Input either R or a number.
R will take you to the custom rule adding while a number will delve straight into FizzBuzzPop.
When you add a rule, you will be prompted to add a positive number(>0) and then a word to replace numbers that are divisible by your inputted number. You can then decide if you still want to add another custom rule or if you want to play the game.
Program will then ask if you would like to play again. Y/y will loop the program again, any other input will result in the program exiting.

Notes:
I coded this in VS2017 and it doesnt require special attention upon building the program.
